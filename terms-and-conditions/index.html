            </p>

            <h2>6. Subscription and Payments</h2>
            <p>

              or annual basis according to our published pricing plans.
            </p>

            <h3>Subscription Terms</h3>
            <p>The following terms apply to subscriptions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Free trials are available for new users and are limited to one
                per user. Additional free trials are not permitted.
              </li>
              <li>Weekly subscriptions are billed every 7 days</li>
              <li>Monthly subscriptions are billed every 30 days</li>
              <li>Annual subscriptions are billed every 12 months</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Subscription period</strong></p>

            <p>
              The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a
              paid Subscription. You will be billed in advance on a recurring
              and periodic basis (such as daily, weekly, monthly or annually),
              depending on the type of Subscription plan you select when
              purchasing the Subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically
              renew under the exact same conditions unless You cancel it or the
              Company cancels it.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Subscription cancellations</strong></p>
            You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your Account
            settings page(Google Play Console/App Store) or by contacting the
            Company. You will not receive a refund for the fees You already paid
            for Your current Subscription period and You will be able to access
            the Service until the end of Your current Subscription period.
            <p>
              If the Subscription has been made through an In-app Purchase, You
              can cancel the renewal of Your Subscription with the Application
              Store.
            </p>

            <strong>Billing</strong>
            <p>
              If the Subscription has been made through an In-app Purchase, all
              billing is handled by the Application Store and is governed by the
              Application Store's own terms and conditions.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Fee Changes</strong></p>
            <p>
              The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify
              the Subscription fees. Any Subscription fee change will become
              effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee
              change comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the
              modified Subscription fee amount.
            </p>

            <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>
              All payments are final and non-refundable. All payments are final
              and non-refundable, as each interpretation request incurs
              immediate computational costs. However, we prioritize fairness and
              customer satisfaction. If you suspect an error, please contact our
              support team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by the
              Company on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion
              of the Company.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the Subscription has been made through an In-app purchase, the
              Application Store's refund policy will apply. If You wish to
              request a refund, You may do so by contacting the Application
              Store directly.
            </p>

            <h3>Automatic Renewal</h3>
            <p>
              Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24
              hours before the renewal date through your device's subscription
              management settings.
            </p>
